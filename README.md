# Relax-Museum
The Relax Museum The Relax Museum was created for the VR Developer Nanodegree at Udacity.  This is app is targeted towards people who struggle with anxiety and panic disorder.  This particular topic was used because I also suffer from an anxiety disorder which actually came about while taking this program.  In this app we send the user to a tranquil environment to escape the harsh effects of anxiety and panic.  The user begins outside of the museum where he/she needs to click on the admission card to enter the exhibit.  Throughout the exhibit there is information which is clickable and guides to user on the key components to not only understanding anxiety/panic but how to combat it.
